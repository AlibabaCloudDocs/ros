# Overview

ROS Cloud Development Toolkit \(CDK\) is a command-line tool that helps you define cloud resources in a variety of programming languages. ROS CDK allows you to create and configure resources and implement automatic deployment and O&M without the need to use the complex JSON or YAML template syntax.

## Scenarios

ROS CDK offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define and create cloud resources in an efficient manner.

## Benefits

-   Open source code: ROS CDK is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/aliyun/Resource-Orchestration-Service-Cloud-Development-Kit) for easy access.
-   Support for multiple programming languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python are supported.
-   Support for various cloud services and resources: 276 resource types of 60 Alibaba Cloud services are supported.
-   Simple code development: The underlying data structure and logic defined in ROS CDK helps you perform complex orchestration operations by using a small amount of code.
